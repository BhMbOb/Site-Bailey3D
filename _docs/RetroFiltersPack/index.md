## **Getting Started:**
<section id="getting_started"/>

Getting started is as easy as adding one of the pre-existing material templates to a post-processing volume in your map.

If you're new to Unreal, take a look at the documentation by Epic on how to set up a post processing volume in your scene, and apply a material.
