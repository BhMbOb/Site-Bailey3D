I"™<p>Asset Library is a series of pipeline tools I‚Äôve created for my own personal projects.</p>

<p>The main goals of these are to maximize the efficiency of bringing asset types from many DCC Packages to the final game.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs all a somewhat personal solution to my own project needs, and is constantly evolving, but since it‚Äôs starting to morph into a tangible set of tools I thought writing a post on it could be interesting.</p>

<h3 id="asset-standardization">Asset Standardization</h3>

<p>Possibly the most important part of the whole process is having standardization in how assets and files are named, and the folder structures.
I‚Äôve chosen to implement new file types for each of the major assets (.material, .geometry, .shader), which stores metadata such as where the final binary assets are stored (relative to the asset library), and various parameters for the asset type.</p>

<p>Below you can see an example of the folder structure for a geometry asset. It‚Äôs been stored in a base folder with the name of the asset, and contains child folders for all materials, textures and geometry files (fbx)</p>

<p>Asset Library is a series of pipeline tools and standardizations I‚Äôve implemented into my own personal game projects, with a few main goals, all focused on maximizing the efficiency of taking content from various DCC Packages to the final Game.</p>

<p>This is a somewhat personal solution to asset management for my own work, and is constantly evolving. But since it‚Äôs starting to morph into a more tangible pipeline and set of tools in itself I thought a post on it could be interesting.</p>

<p>Below I‚Äôll list a series of the processes and tools that I‚Äôve used to make the asset library pipeline as seamless as possible.</p>

<h3 id="auto-importexport">Auto Import/Export</h3>

<p>The main benefit to the Asset Library structure is the auto importing and exporting.</p>

<p>Since I‚Äôm following a strict asset structure, tools can be built around this, meaning that assets can be automatically exported to the correct locations from programs such as Substance Designer and 3DS Max.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="asset-types">Asset Types</h3>

<p>I chose to add a new metadata asset type for all of the major asset types used in DCC applications. These files contain information on things like, material paths for geometry files, filepath history for asset management use, and shader parameters for materials and such.</p>

<p>The current Asset types I‚Äôm using are: <strong>.geometry - .material - .shader</strong></p>

<p>With future plans to include: <strong>.foliage - .texture - .prefab</strong></p>

<p>There are a few advantages to adding custom metadata file types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Standardization of exporting / importing process, meaning tools can be designed around automating the creation and usage of these files. At this point I don‚Äôt worry about importing individual asset files, but can import assets as a whole with all their dependencies. For example, .geometry files have .material file dependencies, which have .texture dependencies, the Asset Library importers allows for importing the whole dependency stack with a single click.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Store any useful information for assets, useful for things like import/export tools, and also means we don‚Äôt have to worry about parsing external file types (Eg, .uasset/.fbx)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storing Asset Library relative information, such as relative paths to Asset Library materials in .geometry files, and Asset Library textures in .material files</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the image below you can see the file structure for a single .geometry asset. The ‚Äútextures‚Äù, ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù, and ‚Äúgeometry‚Äù folders all include the respective sub-asset data needed to import to programs.</p>

<h3 id="asset-types--asset-serialization">Asset Types / Asset Serialization</h3>

<p>One of the first things I found I needed for this process were certain metadata type files, for all of the main asset types used.
Rather than creating bespoke file formats (such as .uasset), I‚Äôm instead using a .json file as the base of all my asset metadata.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm currently using 4 main types of asset metadata  files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>.material, this stores the data on all parameters needed for a final surface (including textures)</li>
  <li>.geometry, this is typically used for geometric asset types and stores data on which .FBX asset to target and the asset library .material files that it contains.</li>
  <li>.shader,</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="asset-structure-standardization">Asset Structure Standardization</h3>

<p>One of the most important (and possibly least interesting) goals of the Asset Library, was creating logical naming conventions and folder structures for all of my assets.</p>
